# ðŸ§  Digit Classifier Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network using **NumPy** â€” no deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

It classifies handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using a two-layer neural network trained from scratch.

## ðŸš€ Features

- No external ML libraries (built entirely with NumPy)
- 2-layer neural network (1 hidden layer with ReLU, 1 output layer with softmax)
- Manual implementation of:
  - Forward propagation
  - Backward propagation (with gradients)
  - Parameter updates using gradient descent
- Works on MNIST-style digit data (28Ã—28 grayscale)
- Computes training and validation accuracy
